"""PyAutoMind prompt-file lifecycle engine.

The Mind runs the prompt file through three states that mirror the task ledger:

    draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md   intaken, not started   (backlog)
    active/<name>.md                        issued, in flight      (active.md)
    complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md          shipped                (the record IS the ledger)

Completion state lives ONLY in the dated records plus the generated
`complete/index.md`. The monolithic `complete.md` ledger was retired on
2026-07-16 (issue #81) — its history is in git, and the one-time split/backfill
tooling (`split-complete`, `migrate`) was deleted with it.

Subcommands
-----------
  move <name> [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
        Advance one file active/<name>.md -> complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<name>.md.
        Date from --date, else inferred from an existing dated record with the
        same slug. For a shipped task prefer `record`, which writes the rich
        record and folds the prompt in one step.

  record <slug> --date YYYY-MM-DD --from-file <path> [--prompt <name>]
        The ship_* hook: write complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md from the rich
        completion body in <path> (drafted by the ship skill), folding and
        removing the active/ prompt. Run `index --apply` afterwards.

  close <slug> --date YYYY-MM-DD --from-file <path> [--prompt <path|name>]
        [--pr Repo#N ...] [--tier glance --gate "<cell>" --action <what>]
        [--no-shadow-row] [--apply]
        The /prm hook: the whole Mind-side close-out as one verb — `record`
        (which folds the prompt, refreshes the index and prunes active.md),
        plus the parked.md/planned.md pointer, plus the tier-`glance` shadow
        row, plus the sweep for references the merge falsified (printed, never
        rewritten). Dry run by default. Unlike `record --prompt` it resolves a
        draft/ prompt too, and it stages nothing. It does NOT render the
        dashboard — `main` heals the render — and it refuses when the record
        already exists or the slug names no prompt.

  index [--apply | --check]
        Generate complete/index.md (token-light navigation over the records);
        --check fails if it is stale (CI).

  dates [--write | --check]
        The date on every active/issued task: report what carries none, or
        --write to backfill it from git history (the commit that introduced
        the entry / moved the prompt into active/). See "task dates" below.

  check [--paths PATH ...] [--base REF]
        Drift guard (mirrors repos_sync.py --check; non-zero exit on drift):
          * no active.md slug has a complete/ record (finished but still active)
          * no file lives in two states at once
          * every registry `prompt:` path resolves, exactly rather than by
            fallback, and into the state folder its registry implies
          * no slug is listed in two registries at once
          * no active/ prompt is left unclaimed by every registry
          * nothing lives under active/ except top-level prompt .md files
            (subdirectories and scripts are invisible to every other guard)
        Wire into /health and CI. `--paths` scopes the EXIT CODE to the
        findings about those paths (a branch can only be held to its own
        diff — see REFERENCE.md "Scoping a drift check to one branch");
        everything else prints as `~ out of scope`. With a registry file in
        --paths, `--base <ref>` narrows it to the entries that ref's diff
        touched.

  orphans
        The focused view of `check`'s last leg: active/ prompts that no registry
        entry claims. `check` grades this too — this lists only them.

  issues
        The ONLINE leg (needs network — `gh` when installed, else plain HTTPS
        with an optional GITHUB_TOKEN; deliberately not part of `check`, which
        stays hermetic): every registry entry's tracking issue AND every
        `status: pr-open` PR cross-checked against GitHub. Catches finished
        work still listed as pending — including the crashed-ship case where
        the PR merged but the session died before closing the issue, so the
        issue leg alone stays green. Run daily by registry_reconcile.yml
        (instance automation — deliberately not part of the shipped
        lifecycle_drift.yml, which must stay schedule-free per spawn rule 9).

This file is intentionally stdlib-only (no PyAuto imports) so it runs in any
environment, including a bare template checkout.

# task dates
#
# Until 2026-08-23 the Mind dated only what it FINISHED: every complete/ record
# carries `completed:`, but a task that had merely been picked up carried no
# date at all. active.md rows said it in prose when a session remembered to
# ("- issue: …/1501 (issued 2026-08-19)"), which nothing could read back — so
# the Mind could answer "what shipped in July?" and not "what did we start?".
#
# The convention: every registry entry carries ONE zero-indent date field, and
# every issued prompt an `Issued:` header line. The KEY names the event, so the
# date reads as something that happened rather than a bare timestamp:
#
#     active.md    - issued: YYYY-MM-DD    the day the task got its issue
#     planned.md   - filed:  YYYY-MM-DD    the day it was scoped
#     parked.md    - parked: YYYY-MM-DD    the day it stopped
#     active/*.md  Issued: YYYY-MM-DD      the prompt's own copy (survives a
#                                          registry row going missing)
#
# `dates` reports what carries none; `dates --write` backfills from git — the
# commit that first introduced the entry, or that moved the prompt into

# drop the registry entry, append the tier-`glance` shadow row, regenerate
# complete/index.md, repoint what the merge falsified. Every one of them was a
# step a session could skip — two of them (the index and the `active.md` prune)
# were folded into `record` after exactly that, each following its own
# drift-alarm email storm. `close` is the composition of the rest: it CALLS the
# existing verbs, it does not reimplement them.
#
# Two things it deliberately does not do. It never rewrites a reference — it
# prints them under "repoint these", because which ones the merge falsified is
# a judgement. And it never renders the dashboard: the state is the Mind's and
# the renderer is the Brain's, so `main` heals the render
# (dashboard_refresh.yml) and the command to force it is printed as the
# optional next step.
#
# It also touches nothing in git: the record is written and the prompt removed
# with plain filesystem ops, and nothing is staged. Stage what it changed
# yourself, in the one commit the close-out makes.
