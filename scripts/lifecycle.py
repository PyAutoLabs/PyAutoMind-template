"""PyAutoMind prompt-file lifecycle engine.

The Mind runs the prompt file through three states that mirror the task ledger:

    draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md   intaken, not started   (backlog)
    active/<name>.md                        issued, in flight      (active.md)
    complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md          shipped                (the record IS the ledger)

Completion state lives ONLY in the dated records plus the generated
`complete/index.md`. The monolithic `complete.md` ledger was retired on
2026-07-16 (issue #81) — its history is in git, and the one-time split/backfill
tooling (`split-complete`, `migrate`) was deleted with it.

Subcommands
-----------
  move <name> [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
        Advance one file active/<name>.md -> complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<name>.md.
        Date from --date, else inferred from an existing dated record with the
        same slug. For a shipped task prefer `record`, which writes the rich
        record and folds the prompt in one step.

  record <slug> --date YYYY-MM-DD --from-file <path> [--prompt <name>]
        The ship_* hook: write complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md from the rich
        completion body in <path> (drafted by the ship skill), folding and
        removing the active/ prompt. Run `index --apply` afterwards.

  index [--apply | --check]
        Generate complete/index.md (token-light navigation over the records);
        --check fails if it is stale (CI).

  dates [--write | --check]
        The date on every active/issued task: report what carries none, or
        --write to backfill it from git history (the commit that introduced
        the entry / moved the prompt into active/). See "task dates" below.

  check
        Drift guard (mirrors repos_sync.py --check; non-zero exit on drift):
          * no active.md slug has a complete/ record (finished but still active)
          * no file lives in two states at once
          * every registry `prompt:` path resolves, exactly rather than by
            fallback, and into the state folder its registry implies
          * no slug is listed in two registries at once
          * no active/ prompt is left unclaimed by every registry
          * nothing lives under active/ except top-level prompt .md files
            (subdirectories and scripts are invisible to every other guard)
        Wire into /health and CI.

  orphans
        The focused view of `check`'s last leg: active/ prompts that no registry
        entry claims. `check` grades this too — this lists only them.

  issues
        The ONLINE leg (needs network — `gh` when installed, else plain HTTPS
        with an optional GITHUB_TOKEN; deliberately not part of `check`, which
        stays hermetic): every registry entry's tracking issue AND every
        `status: pr-open` PR cross-checked against GitHub. Catches finished
        work still listed as pending — including the crashed-ship case where
        the PR merged but the session died before closing the issue, so the
        issue leg alone stays green. Run daily by registry_reconcile.yml
        (instance automation — deliberately not part of the shipped
        lifecycle_drift.yml, which must stay schedule-free per spawn rule 9).

This file is intentionally stdlib-only (no PyAuto imports) so it runs in any
environment, including a bare template checkout.

# task dates
#
# Until 2026-08-23 the Mind dated only what it FINISHED: every complete/ record
# carries `completed:`, but a task that had merely been picked up carried no
# date at all. active.md rows said it in prose when a session remembered to
# ("- issue: …/1501 (issued 2026-08-19)"), which nothing could read back — so
# the Mind could answer "what shipped in July?" and not "what did we start?".
#
# The convention: every registry entry carries ONE zero-indent date field, and
# every issued prompt an `Issued:` header line. The KEY names the event, so the
# date reads as something that happened rather than a bare timestamp:
#
#     active.md    - issued: YYYY-MM-DD    the day the task got its issue
#     planned.md   - filed:  YYYY-MM-DD    the day it was scoped
#     parked.md    - parked: YYYY-MM-DD    the day it stopped
#     active/*.md  Issued: YYYY-MM-DD      the prompt's own copy (survives a
#                                          registry row going missing)
#
# `dates` reports what carries none; `dates --write` backfills from git — the
# commit that first introduced the entry, or that moved the prompt into
# active/. Retroactive by construction: the history already knows the dates,
# they were simply never written down where a reader could see them.
