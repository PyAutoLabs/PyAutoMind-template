"""spawn — stamp fresh-slate template repos from the live Mind and Memory.

Implements docs/pyautobrain/spawn_spec.md (the partition rules are data
below; change the spec first, then mirror it here). Same doctrine as
repos_sync.py: single source (the live repos) -> generated view (the
templates), re-runnable, drift-checked.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/spawn.py                     # dry-run: print the file plan
    python3 scripts/spawn.py --write DIR         # materialise templates under DIR
    python3 scripts/spawn.py --check DIR         # regenerate + diff (CI; exit 1 on drift)
    python3 scripts/spawn.py --stamp-family DIR  # stamp mechanical layers into family checkouts
    python3 scripts/spawn.py --root DIR          # override the workspace root

spawn never mutates a live repo. Only tracked files (git ls-files) are read.
Every file is assigned by the FIRST matching rule; unmatched files are
DROP + WARN and the run fails on any WARN (extend the spec's tables via a
human decision, then mirror here).
