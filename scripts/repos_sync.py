"""Sync + drift-check the organism's body map (PyAutoMind/repos.yaml).

repos.yaml is the single source of repo IDENTITY (GitHub home, category,
one-line role). This script keeps the generated doc blocks in step with it and
checks every other hand-maintained repo list against it.

Usage:
    python3 repos_sync.py [--check]      # drift checks only (default)
    python3 repos_sync.py --write        # regenerate docs/hooks, then check
    python3 repos_sync.py --write --only "generated Codex hooks"
                                         # bounded Codex-hook regeneration
    python3 repos_sync.py --write --only "shared-standards blocks (generated)" --repo NAME
                                         # bounded standards-only regeneration
    python3 repos_sync.py --root <dir>   # override the workspace root
                                         # (default: PyAutoBrain's shared
                                         # resolver — see workspace_root)
    python3 repos_sync.py --only <label> # run one check leg (repeatable) —
                                         # what an organ's PR CI gate calls
    python3 repos_sync.py --skip <label> # run every leg BUT this one
                                         # (repeatable; subtracts from --only)

`--only` narrows the run to the legs it names; `--skip` then subtracts from
whatever is selected, so `--only A --only B --skip B` runs A. An unregistered
label is an error for either flag — a typo can never silently disable a gate.
A leg is skipped only when its precondition cannot be met by the caller: the
`generated hooks` leg, for one, compares every checked-out repo's installed
copy against the canonical hook, and a PR that EDITS the canonical hook cannot
make the sibling copies match — only the post-merge propagation workflow can.

--write writes `<root>/.pyauto-root`, the workspace-root marker every consumer
resolves the root by (`PyAutoBrain/agents/_pyauto_root.py`): a generated
artifact of the body map rather than a file each machine places by hand.

--write regenerates the blocks between `<!-- repos_sync:begin -->` /
`<!-- repos_sync:end -->` markers in:

  * <root>/AGENTS.md                       — the repo routing table
  * <root>/PyAutoBrain/skills/WORKFLOW.md  — the GitHub owner map

and, between `<!-- repos_sync:map:begin -->` / `<!-- repos_sync:map:end -->`
markers, the compact **organism map** in each organ repo's own AGENTS.md
(<root>/<organ>/AGENTS.md). The map is the always-loaded orientation an agent
sees first: the peer organs, their roles, the call chain and the
conductor/faculty rule — so a session opened in one repo still knows the whole
organism. A repo opts in by adding the map markers to its AGENTS.md; organ
repos (or roots) that are absent, or lack the markers, are skipped rather than
failing the run.

--write also installs the two generated hooks into every checked-out repo,
both registered in `<repo>/.claude/settings.json`:

  * `policy/session_start_hook.sh` -> `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`
    (SessionStart) — what makes a Claude Code web/mobile session run Python
    3.12 instead of the container's 3.11 default;
  * `policy/end_at_deliverable_hook.sh` -> `.claude/hooks/end-at-deliverable.sh`
    (PreToolUse, matching the timer-shaped tools) — the guard that enforces
    `policy/end_at_deliverable.md`: a session ends at its deliverable and never
    arms `send_later` / `subscribe_pr_activity` / `CronCreate` / `ScheduleWakeup`
    / `RemoteTrigger` create-update-run to wait for CI, a review or a merge.

The copies must be byte-identical to the canonical files, so `--check` fails on
any edit made to a copy.

`.claude/` is the only top-level entry --write creates in a target repo, and a
repo may lint its own layout. Before writing it, --write reads that repo's own
allowlist (see "Structure-lint agreement" below) and skips a repo that has not
allowlisted the entry, rather than breaking that repo's CI with a path it
rejects.

--write also REMOVES one thing: the retired `CLAUDE.md` -> `AGENTS.md` pointer
(PyAutoMind#482), at a repo's root and in every tracked folder below it that has
an AGENTS.md (PyAutoMind#484). Claude Code loads AGENTS.md natively now, and any
CLAUDE.md in the cwd or an ancestor makes it ignore every AGENTS.md, so the
pointer hides the file it points at. Only a content-free pointer is deleted; a
CLAUDE.md carrying real guidance is reported and left for a human (see
"CLAUDE.md retirement").

--check (always run) verifies, against the manifest:

  * PyAutoHeart/config/repos.yaml          — polled repos exist, owners match,
    smoke: and version_skew: name manifest repos and manifest package names
  * PyAutoHands/pre_build.sh               — run_workspace repos exist
  * PyAutoHands/autohands/config/workspaces.yaml — run_all repos, library
    names/packages and slow_skip_default repos exist
  * PyAutoBrain/bin/ensure_workspace_labels.sh — owner/name pairs match
  * the hygiene conductor — the repo sets it scans are derived from this
    manifest, and no repo name has been hardcoded back into an array
  * the `origin` remote of every local checkout — manifest matches reality
  * the workspace checkouts, BOTH ways — every manifest repo is checked out
    here, and every checkout here is a manifest repo (or is declared under
    `unmapped_checkouts:`). Every other leg skips an absent repo, which is
    right for that leg and wrong in aggregate: eleven checks reporting OK
    over a repo that is not there is reduced coverage reading as health. Held
    only against a root carrying the `.pyauto-root` marker — a CI matrix or a
    web session clones a handful of repos side by side, where "you are missing
    thirty" is noise, so there the leg prints its denominator and fails
    nothing.
  * the tenant firewall — no instance fact (satellite repo name, GitHub
    owner, workspace path) in Brain/Heart/Build *.py / *.sh outside the
    declared config surfaces (FIREWALL_ALLOWLIST below)
  * both generated hooks — present, executable, byte-identical to
    policy/session_start_hook.sh and policy/end_at_deliverable_hook.sh, and
    registered in .claude/settings.json (SessionStart / PreToolUse)
  * the end-at-deliverable policy block — unlike the other generated blocks
    this one is NOT opt-in-silent: an AGENTS.md without the markers is
    reported, because a repo missing this safety rule is the failure mode.
    --write inserts the markers itself under an existing history block
  * the where-to-file policy block — same not-silent contract as the
    deliverable block (a repo without it is reported); --write inserts the
    markers itself under an existing deliverable block
  * the CLAUDE.md retirement (leg "CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md pointers") — a
    checked-out repo that has an AGENTS.md has NO CLAUDE.md, and neither has
    any tracked folder below its root that has one (`git ls-files`, so
    untracked/ignored trees are never read); each one still present is
    named, as a removable pointer or as content to move by hand
  * target-repo layout lints — every checked-out repo that lints its own
    top-level entries allowlists the `.claude/` that --write installs (a repo
    that does not is skipped by --write and named here)

# because an unscanned repo yields no findings — the conductor reported clean and
# was believed. The tenant firewall could not catch it either; its allowlist
# PERMITTED the stale names rather than checking coverage.
#
# So this check has two legs, because either alone is escapable:

# Standard: guidance lives in the agnostic AGENTS.md, and a repo that HAS an
# AGENTS.md has NO CLAUDE.md. Claude Code (>= 2.1.277) loads AGENTS.md natively,
# but in its default mode any CLAUDE.md in the cwd or an ancestor makes it ignore
# every AGENTS.md — so the content-free pointer every repo used to carry (a
# CLAUDE.md that `@`-imported AGENTS.md) now hides the file it pointed at. Codex,
# Cursor etc. read AGENTS.md directly and never read CLAUDE.md, so retiring it
# changes nothing for them.
#
# The check leg keeps its old printed name, "CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md pointers",
# byte-identical: PyAutoHeart's manifest-drift parser keys on it. The removal
# side deletes only a content-free pointer; a CLAUDE.md carrying anything else
# is reported for a human to fold into AGENTS.md, never deleted. Absent
# (not-checked-out) repos are skipped, exactly like the map-block generation, so
# this runs cleanly in a partial/web checkout; repos with no AGENTS.md are out
# of scope (a CLAUDE.md there may be the repo's only guidance).
#
# Nested folders (PyAutoMind#484): the same rule applies to every TRACKED
# CLAUDE.md below a repo's root — a session started inside such a folder loses
# every ancestor AGENTS.md. Discovery is `git ls-files`, never a directory walk,
# and a nested CLAUDE.md with no sibling AGENTS.md is out of scope exactly like
# a root one in a repo with no AGENTS.md.

# `--write` creates exactly one top-level entry in a target repo: the
# `.claude/` tooling folder (the `CLAUDE.md` pointer it used to create is now
# retired and only ever removed, which no allowlist can object to). A repo may
# lint its own layout — an allowlist of the top-level entries it accepts — and
# such a repo has no way to know this script is about to write into it. Installing
# `.claude/` into a repo whose lint has not allowlisted it breaks that repo's
# CI, and the breakage reads as the repo's fault rather than as this script's.
#
# So: before writing, ask the target's own lint whether it accepts what is
# about to be created. The lint stays the single authority — its allowlist is
# READ (never executed, never copied here), so a repo that adds `.claude` to
# its allowlist is covered again on the next run with no change on this side.
# Repos with no lint are the common case and are untouched by any of this.

# Where a repo is expected to keep its layout lint. A repo that keeps one
# somewhere else is not covered — a real, bounded gap: extend this tuple when a
# repo lints its layout from a different path. Detection is by convention
# because the alternative (a per-repo key in repos.yaml) would put POLICY in the
# body map, which is identity-only by contract.
