"""Sync + drift-check the organism's body map (PyAutoMind/repos.yaml).

repos.yaml is the single source of repo IDENTITY (GitHub home, category,
one-line role). This script keeps the generated doc blocks in step with it and
checks every other hand-maintained repo list against it.

Usage:
    python3 repos_sync.py [--check]      # drift checks only (default)
    python3 repos_sync.py --write        # regenerate doc blocks, then check
    python3 repos_sync.py --root <dir>   # override the workspace root
    python3 repos_sync.py --only <label> # run one check leg (repeatable) —
                                         # what an organ's PR CI gate calls

--write regenerates the blocks between `<!-- repos_sync:begin -->` /
`<!-- repos_sync:end -->` markers in:

  * <root>/AGENTS.md                       — the repo routing table
  * <root>/PyAutoBrain/skills/WORKFLOW.md  — the GitHub owner map

and, between `<!-- repos_sync:map:begin -->` / `<!-- repos_sync:map:end -->`
markers, the compact **organism map** in each organ repo's own AGENTS.md
(<root>/<organ>/AGENTS.md). The map is the always-loaded orientation an agent
sees first: the peer organs, their roles, the call chain and the
conductor/faculty rule — so a session opened in one repo still knows the whole
organism. A repo opts in by adding the map markers to its AGENTS.md; organ
repos (or roots) that are absent, or lack the markers, are skipped rather than
failing the run.

--check (always run) verifies, against the manifest:

  * PyAutoHeart/config/repos.yaml          — polled repos exist, owners match
  * PyAutoHands/pre_build.sh               — run_workspace repos exist
  * PyAutoBrain/bin/ensure_workspace_labels.sh — owner/name pairs match
  * the hygiene conductor — the repo sets it scans are derived from this
    manifest, and no repo name has been hardcoded back into an array
  * the `origin` remote of every local checkout — manifest matches reality
  * the tenant firewall — no instance fact (satellite repo name, GitHub
    owner, workspace path) in Brain/Heart/Build *.py / *.sh outside the
    declared config surfaces (FIREWALL_ALLOWLIST below)

Exit code 0 = no drift; 1 = drift found (each mismatch printed).

#

#      fallback parser that quietly drops a repo is precisely this bug's class,
