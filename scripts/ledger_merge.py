"""Classify a PyAutoMind branch diff as *ledger* or *code*.

WHY THIS EXISTS. PyAutoMind's own work strands. A branch-scoped session (the
phone, claude.ai/code, any `claude/**` or `codex/**` flow) pushes its Mind changes to a
feature branch — `prompt_sync.sh` pushes HEAD deliberately, so a cloud session
cannot bypass review — and then nothing moves them. No workflow even *looks* at
a `claude/**` or `codex/**` push: `lifecycle_drift`, `dashboard_refresh`, `firewall_gate` and
`spawn_drift` all trigger on `push: main` or `pull_request` only. The branch
sits there until a human writes an explicit "merge this" prompt.

Almost all of what strands is *ledger*: a prompt filed under `draft/`, a task
moved `active/` → `complete/`, a registry line, a regenerated dashboard. It is
the organism's own bookkeeping, it is generated or template-shaped, its drift
checks are already automated, and a human reviewing it adds nothing. The
minority that is *code* — `scripts/`, `tests/`, `.github/`, `skills/`,
`policy/`, `repos.yaml`, the doc pages — is exactly what review is for.

So this script draws that line, and `mind_ledger_merge.yml` merges only what
falls on the ledger side of it. The gate is a script, not workflow YAML, so it
is testable and so a session can predict the verdict before it pushes.

DEFAULT DENY. A path is ledger only by matching a rule below; an unrecognised
one — a new root file, a new top-level folder — is code. Getting that backwards
would auto-merge the next thing nobody thought about.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/ledger_merge.py classify --base origin/main   # diff HEAD vs base
    python3 scripts/ledger_merge.py classify path/one path/two    # explicit paths
    ... < paths-on-stdin
    python3 scripts/ledger_merge.py merge-entries BASE OURS THEIRS [--write PATH]
    python3 scripts/ledger_merge.py resolve      # inside a conflicted `git merge`

CONFLICTS ARE SETTLED BY THE FILE'S GRAMMAR, NOT BY A HUMAN. Every ledger
branch rewrites the same few files — the `## slug` registries and the
generated renders — so git's line merge stops on two branches that never
touched the same entry (24 of 100 runs in the week to 2026-09-17, six
completion records stranded, nobody told). `merge-entries` is a three-way
merge at entry granularity; `resolve` applies it to the registries of an
in-progress merge, takes main's copy of the renders (they are regenerated on
the merged tree), and leaves only a genuine both-sides edit of one slug — or
a path the grammar does not cover — for a human.

Sources take precedence in that order: explicit paths, then `--base`, then
stdin. Stdin is read only when neither of the others is given, so a `--base`
run never blocks on a stdin that stays open (a harness socket).

Exit codes: 0 = ledger-only (safe to auto-merge) · 1 = holds code (a human's
call) · 2 = the script could not run. The caller must distinguish 1 from 2:
"a human should look" and "the gate is broken" are not the same answer.

# merge git would do if it knew the file's grammar: an entry is one unit,
# changed by at most one side, and only a genuine both-sides edit of the SAME
# slug is a conflict.
#
# The preamble (everything before the first `## `, including the generated
# `<!-- toc:start -->` block) is taken from OURS; the caller regenerates the
# contents block (`registry_toc.py --write`) after the merge.
