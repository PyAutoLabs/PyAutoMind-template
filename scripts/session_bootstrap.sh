# scripts/session_bootstrap.sh — make a remote session's environment correct,
# from anywhere, without depending on the SessionStart hook having fired.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `policy/session_start_hook.sh` is the right mechanism and does the real work.
# But Claude Code registers project hooks from the session's *project
# directory*, and a session scoped to several organs clones them side by side
# under that directory — so the project directory is their parent, which is not
# a repo, has no `.claude/`, and registers no hook at all. Every multi-repo
# remote session therefore came up on the container's Python 3.11: one minor
# below the floor this organism set for itself and below every CI leg, with
# mypy and flake8 reading the interpreter and judging code against 3.11 rules.
# Local-green/CI-red, over and over, for an environment reason no one could see
# from inside the session.
#
# The hook now installs a workspace-root fan-out when it detects that layout,
# which fixes the *next* session in a container. This script is the other half:
# the door anything can knock on to fix the session it is already in. It is
# idempotent and ~0.2s warm, so calling it defensively costs nothing.
#
#   bash PyAutoMind/scripts/session_bootstrap.sh          # ensure, quietly
#   bash PyAutoMind/scripts/session_bootstrap.sh --check  # report, change nothing
#
# `bin/pyauto-brain` calls it before dispatch, so every `/verb` is covered.
# Exits 0 whenever the session is usable — this is a bootstrap, never a gate.

# parent of this checkout where it is not — which is what this script assumed
# before the resolver existed, and is still right for a side-by-side remote
