# Routing — prompt taxonomy → PyAutoBrain agents

PyAutoMind stores **intent**. PyAutoBrain reasons over that intent and routes it
to the right specialist agent. This file defines the contract between the two:
the first folder of every prompt path declares the *kind of work*, and PyAutoBrain
maps that to a reasoning agent.

> PyAutoMind organises intent by the kind of thinking required; PyAutoBrain uses
> that structure to choose the right reasoning agent.

## The map

Draft prompts live at `draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md`. The **work-type**
(first folder under `draft/`) determines the agent; the **target** (second
folder) tells the agent which repo or domain is affected. Once issued the file
advances to `active/`, and on merge to `complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/` (issue #71).

| Work-type folder | Intent | PyAutoBrain agent |
|------------------|--------|-------------------|
| `feature/`       | new user-facing or scientific capabilities | feature planner |
| `bug/`           | incorrect behaviour, crashes, regressions | debugger |
| `refactor/`      | internal restructuring, no intended behaviour change | Refactor Agent (conductor; default-safe under `--auto`) |
| `docs/`          | documentation, tutorials, notebooks, examples | documentation agent; workspace/HowTo *example authorship* → Workspace Agent (conductor) |
| `test/`          | test coverage, smoke tests, validation scripts | test engineer |
| `release/`       | packaging, versions, deployment, release readiness | release engineer |
| `maintenance/`   | dependency updates, hygiene, cleanup, small technical debt | hygiene agent |
| `research/`      | exploratory scientific / algorithmic investigation before implementation | research analyst |
| `human_review/`  | work that already **shipped** and a human wants to read and sign off | (none — a human reviews; never auto-filed) |
| `triage/`        | classification still unclear | (human triages, then re-homes) |

`human_review/` is the one work-type nothing may infer. Every other folder is a
reading of what a prompt is *about*; this one records a human's judgement that a
**completed** task needs their eyes before it counts as done — so it is reachable
only by declaring `Type: human review` (`human-review`/`human_review` read the
same), and a task never lands there by default. Review is opt-in, not a lifecycle
stage: an empty section means nothing was flagged, not that nothing shipped. It
has no PyAutoBrain agent, because there is nothing left to dispatch — the work is
done and a person is the reviewer. It surfaces as its own **Human review**
section on `dashboard.md`, directly under *In flight*, and is deliberately not
counted as backlog.

## Targets (second folder)

The canonical list of repos (with GitHub home, category and role) is
`repos.yaml` in this repo — the organism's body map.

The second folder names the affected repo or domain, e.g. `autoarray`, `autofit`,
`autogalaxy`, `autolens`, `autolens_assistant`, `autolens_profiling`,
`autolens_inference`, `autolens_visualization`, `autogalaxy_visualization`,
`autofit_visualization`, `autocti_visualization`,
`autolens_workspace_developer`, `autohands`,
`pyautobrain`, `pyautoeyes`, `pyautopulse`; the workspace bucket `workspaces`; or a topic series kept
together as a unit (`jax_substructure`, `weak`, `cluster`, `priors`).

Within the libraries, work classifies as **library** vs **workspace** for the
`/start_library` ↔ `/start_workspace` split — but that is decided from the
`@RepoName` references in the prompt body, *not* from the folder. The folder is
for human + agent legibility and PyAutoBrain routing.

## Scope of this file

This repository **only defines the taxonomy and the metadata/documentation** that
PyAutoBrain consumes. The agents themselves are **not** implemented here — they
live in PyAutoBrain. Prompts that *implement*
those agents are ordinary `feature/pyautobrain/*.md` prompts.

## The command surface

Humans reach this routing through the short PyAutoBrain **commands** (`/feature`,
`/build`, `/health`, `/bug`, `/refactor`, `/docs`, `/research`, plus the `/route`
NL router). The work-type verbs map onto the folders above; `/route` infers the
work-type from free text. The Brain stays implicit — *users speak in short
commands; PyAutoBrain performs the routing.* Bodies + the boundary live in
`PyAutoBrain/skills/COMMANDS.md`.

## Not routed by work type

`active/` and `complete/` are workflow-lifecycle folders (with
`complete/archive/` for retired epic trackers + shelved prompts). None of these
are work-type folders and PyAutoBrain does not route them.
