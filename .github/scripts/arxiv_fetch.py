"""Fetch newly *announced* strong-lensing papers from the arXiv API into arxiv_papers.json.

Stateless announcement-band window. A paper is not searchable when it is
submitted — it becomes searchable when arXiv *announces* it, one to three days
later. So the window is anchored to arXiv's announcement schedule, not to a
rolling "last N hours" of submission time:

  announcements   20:00 ET, Sun-Thu
  deadlines       14:00 ET, Mon-Fri

Each announcement covers submissions between the previous deadline and its own:

  submitted Mon 14:00 -> Tue 14:00 ET   announced Tue 20:00 ET
  submitted Tue 14:00 -> Wed 14:00 ET   announced Wed 20:00 ET
  submitted Wed 14:00 -> Thu 14:00 ET   announced Thu 20:00 ET
  submitted Thu 14:00 -> Fri 14:00 ET   announced Sun 20:00 ET
  submitted Fri 14:00 -> Mon 14:00 ET   announced Mon 20:00 ET   (3-day band)

The 02:00 UTC cron lands at 21:00-22:00 ET the *previous* day, just after that
day's 20:00 ET announcement, so the Mon-Fri runs take the bands Thu->Fri,
Fri->Mon, Mon->Tue, Tue->Wed, Wed->Thu. Their union is exactly one week with no
overlap: disjoint and gapless, with no cross-run state. The band is stable from
one 20:00 ET announcement to the next, so it absorbs ~22 h of cron slip (GitHub
cron only ever fires late).

The filter is still on <published> (v1), not <updated>, so v2 revisions and old
cross-lists do not resurface.

History: until 2026-07-15 this used a rolling 24 h window (72 h on Mondays)
against submission time. That silently and permanently dropped every paper whose
announcement lag pushed its v1 timestamp outside the window — e.g. 2607.12129
and 2607.12209, submitted Mon 2026-07-13 evening, announced Wed 00:00 UTC, and
by then already too old for Wednesday's 24 h look-back (PyAutoMind#79). Setting
LOOKBACK_HOURS restores the old rolling window for manual test-fires and
backfills.

The second recorded miss, 2607.19459 on 2026-07-21, was a *recall* failure, not
a window one: its band and category were both correct, but its abstract says
"strong gravitational lenses" and "gravitational lensing simulations" and never
any of the phrases then in the query, so `"strong gravitational lensing"` was
added to it (PyAutoMind#92). The two failure modes look identical from the
outside — a paper that never appears — so when one is reported, check the band
and `cat:` clause before assuming either.

# downstream drops the handful of keyword false-positives. Deliberately omits

# "microlensing" so the net stays strong-lensing-shaped; the qualified
# "strong gravitational lensing" is kept, since the qualifier does that job
