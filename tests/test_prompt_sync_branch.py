"""`prompt_sync.sh` must push the branch it is ON, never a hardcoded `main`.

Both helpers used to end in `git push origin main` regardless of what was
checked out. `create_issue` step 6 and `start_dev` step 7 both instruct an agent
to call them, so a branch-scoped session — a cloud session with a designated
branch, or any PR-based flow — that followed the documented steps verbatim
pushed Mind straight to `main`, bypassing review entirely.

These tests drive the real script against throwaway git repos with real bare
remotes, because that is the only way to observe *which ref actually moved*. A
test that merely greps the source for the string would pass on a script that
still pushed the wrong branch by another route.

Fictional fixtures only, per `test_spawn_privacy.py` — `tests/**` is KEEP-copied
verbatim into the public template, so nothing here names a real task or prompt.
