"""Which directory `repos_sync` and `spawn` act on when no `--root` is given.

Both used to answer "the directory above this checkout", which is only true
while the checkouts sit side by side directly under the root. The answer now
comes from PyAutoBrain's shared resolver (`agents/_pyauto_root.py`), so a
workspace that groups its checkouts into subdirectories still resolves to the
root that carries the `.pyauto-root` marker — and there is one answer to the
question instead of one per consumer.

Two properties matter enough to pin:

* **Nothing is required.** No Brain checkout beside us, or no marker anywhere,
  must still yield a usable root — the old answer — because a CI matrix and a
  single-repo web session both look exactly like that.
* **The resolver is Brain-anchored.** It walks up from the BRAIN checkout, so a
  worktree bundle whose PyAutoBrain is a symlink into the canonical workspace
  resolves to the canonical root. Acting on it would regenerate somebody
  else's tree from this checkout's manifest, so a root that does not hold this
  very checkout is refused — unless the operator named it explicitly.

Fictional fixtures only (`tests/**` is copied verbatim into the public
template); the stub resolver below stands in for the real module so the
behaviour under test is this script's, not the Brain's.
