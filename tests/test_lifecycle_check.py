"""Contract tests for the registry-integrity leg of `lifecycle.py check`.

The registry files are the first thing a task-selection pass reads, so a wrong
entry costs a whole session before anyone notices. `check` used to ignore them
completely — it never opened planned.md or parked.md and never resolved a
`prompt:` path — so it printed OK over a registry in which half the entries
pointed at files that had moved, shipped, or never existed.

Two things these tests deliberately do, matching `test_repos_sync_hygiene_coverage.py`:

1. **Fictional fixtures only.** `tests/**` is KEEP-copied verbatim into the
   public template (see `test_spawn_privacy.py`), so nothing here names a real
   repository, task or prompt. It also keeps the tests hermetic — they assert
   the check's logic, not the state of whatever happens to be checked out.
2. **Prove each leg FAILS.** A drift check that cannot fail is decoration.
   Every condition below is driven with input that must trip it, and the
   clean-tree case proves the checks stay quiet when nothing is wrong.
