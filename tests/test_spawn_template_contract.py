"""Contract between spawn's output and the workflows the template itself ships.

The template is not inert: it carries `.github/workflows/lifecycle_drift.yml`,
whose self-heal (PyAutoMind#116) regenerates `complete/index.md` on every push
to the template's own `main`. So spawn must produce every file those workflows
produce, or each sync is followed within seconds by a bot commit creating a file
the next `--check` calls drift — permanently red.

That is exactly what happened on 2026-08-04: sync `51f5ae58` at 17:28:51Z, bot
commit `79864dde` at 17:29:12Z, and the very next dispatch failed on
`only in published: complete/index.md`.

The same file also pins the **fresh-repo invariant** (spec rule 9, issue #121):
a workflow shipped into a template must be able to succeed on a freshly-spawned
repo with no secrets and no sibling repos. The published template had 13 failing
runs from inherited instance automation, and owner substitution does not help —
`YOURORG` is a literal placeholder, so its own `spawn_drift` run failed
`repository 'https://github.com/YOURORG/PyAutoMind/' not found`.

Both halves are the same idea: the template is a live repo with running
workflows, so spawn owns what those workflows do on arrival.
