"""The drift check must see BOTH directions of "is what is declared here?".

Two blind spots, mirror images of each other:

1. **Declared but missing was silently skipped.** Every leg that reads a repo
   skips one that is not checked out — right for that leg, which has nothing to
   read, and wrong in aggregate: after a regroup that left a repo behind,
   eleven checks would report `OK` having inspected nothing, and a successful
   check that means reduced coverage is worse than no check.
2. **On disk but undeclared was silence.** The script walks the manifest and
   asks whether each entry is present, so it structurally could not see a
   checkout that no entry declares — invisible to every manifest-driven sweep,
   including the audit whose whole job was to answer "did we miss a repo?".

The same conventions as the repos_sync tests next door:

1. **Fictional fixtures only.** `tests/**` is KEEP-copied verbatim into the
   public template, so nothing here names a real repository and the assertions
   are about the leg's logic rather than whatever happens to be checked out.
2. **Prove each leg FAILS.** Both directions are driven with input that must
   trip them — a check that cannot fail is decoration.
