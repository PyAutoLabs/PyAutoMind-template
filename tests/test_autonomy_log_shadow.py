"""Contract tests for the tier-`glance` shadow window and its append hook.

The shadow window is a **pre-registered** decision rule. It ran over tier-`notify`
candidates until `notify` auto-merge was granted on 2026-10-02; it now counts
tier-`glance` auto-merges, and 20 clean rows confirm `glance` (any `reverted`
row demotes it). A pre-registered
rule that anyone can quietly reshape is not pre-registered, so two things are
pinned here:

1. **The live ledger's schema** — heading, header row, six cells per row, an
   allowed `human action` on every row the rule actually grades, and a count
   line that agrees with the rows it claims to count. A count line drifting
   from its table is the exact failure that would let the window "reach 20"
   without 20 candidates.
2. **The append itself** — `lifecycle.py shadow-row` on a fixture: dry run
   writes nothing, `--apply` appends exactly one row and moves the count, and
   an action outside the allowed values is refused.

Same two rules as the other lifecycle tests: fictional fixtures only (`tests/**`
is KEEP-copied into the public template), and every leg must be shown to fail
on input that should trip it. The live-ledger legs skip where there is no
shadow window — a freshly spawned Mind ships the bare ledger header.
