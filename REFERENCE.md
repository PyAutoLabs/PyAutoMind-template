# PyAutoMind reference

The registry schemas, prompt conventions, and workflow detail for this repo.
Moved verbatim from `README.md` on 2026-07-10 — agent docs that point at
README sections ("Prompt taxonomy", "Prompt file format", the `active.md` /
completion-record schemas) resolve here, one link from the README.

The read-only context check is `python3 scripts/token_load.py report --root
<workspace-root>`; `check` applies the same measurement to the configured
budgets. It supports grouped main and flat bundle roots, and reports mandatory
AGENTS and core skill files separately from conditional references. In the
September 2026 context pass, Mind `AGENTS.md` fell from 12,507 bytes / 214 lines
to about 5,100 bytes / 94 lines. The broader
`draft/maintenance/organs/reduce_session_token_load.md` remains draft; this
measurement does not imply its Cortex, Memory, or completion-record goals are
done.

## What a prompt looks like

Here's a real prompt — the contents of `autoarray/psf_oversampling.md` — that
became a tracked task. This is the level and style of detail to aim for in
your own GitHub issue: free-form prose, with `@RepoName/path/to/file.py`
references so the tooling knows which repo and files to target. No boilerplate.

````markdown
A point spread function is used to blur images via 2d convolution.

This blurring occurs predominantly in the package @PyAutoArray/autoarray/operators/convolver.py.

The source code currently requires PSF blurring to occur at the same resolution (pixel scale) as the
image, meaning the PSF is always the same resolution as the image.

However, for modeling, convolution can be performed at a higher resolution than the image, which allows for more accurate
blurring and modeling of the image. This requires us to have an oversampled PSF, which is a PSF that has a higher
resolution than the image.

For modeling, where images are generated PSF blurring happens in @PyAutoGalaxy/autogalaxy/operate/image.py.

Modeling can always evaluate images using a hgiher resolition grid, blurring them with the PSF at high
resolution and then downsample to the observed image resolution. Oversampling is implemented in
@PyAutoArray/autoarray/operators/over_sampling.

Note that over sampling often uses an adaptive sub-szie, which means that 2D covnolution with a PSF is not
well defined. for now, we will assume adaptive over sampling is not used.

I want us to be able to append the Convolver class with a convolve_over_sample_size integer, which specifies the over sample size of the PSF.
This will allow us to perform convolution at a higher resolution than the image, which will improve the accuracy of the blurring and modeling of the image.
For example, if convolve_over_sample_size is 2, then the PSF will be oversampled by a factor of 2, meaning it will have a resolution that is 2 times higher than the image.

This, in turn, means out imaging object @PyAutoArray/autoarray/dataset/imaging/dataset.py will need to be
extended to include the convolve_over_sample_size_lp and convolve_over_sample_size_pixelization attributes, which will
specify the over sample size of the PSF for the lensing and pixelization operations, respectively.

class Imaging(AbstractDataset):
    def __init__(
        self,
        data: Array2D,
        noise_map: Optional[Array2D] = None,
        psf: Optional[Convolver] = None,
        psf_setup_state: bool = False,
        noise_covariance_matrix: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
        over_sample_size_lp: Union[int, Array2D] = 4,
        over_sample_size_pixelization: Union[int, Array2D] = 4,
        use_normalized_psf: Optional[bool] = True,
        check_noise_map: bool = True,
        sparse_operator: Optional[ImagingSparseOperator] = None,
    ):


Also,read through the @PyAutoArray/autoarray/inversion/inversion/imaging package, and parents, to see
how PSF convolution enters this. I think we can get it to work in PyAutoArray/autoarray/inversion/inversion/imaging/mapping.py,
and will leave work in PyAutoArray/autoarray/inversion/inversion/imaging/sparse.py to future work.

This is a complex task, therefore I think we should extend @autolens_workspace_test/scripts/imaging/convolution.py
with a numerical test.

We should then build on this test in a separate test file using a simple over sampled PSF, to get a numerical
result we can test the source code against.

@autolens_workspace/scripts/imaging/simulator.py is a good example we can build on to show how to use
over sampled PSFs in a real simulation. We can extend this script to show how to use over sampled PSFs in a real simulation.

Come up with a plan to implement over sampled PSFs.
````

That prompt becomes a GitHub issue, gets routed to the affected repos
(`PyAutoArray`, `PyAutoGalaxy`, the autolens workspaces), and lands as PRs
against each. Typos, half-finished thoughts, and "I think we should…" are
fine — write naturally, the AI fills in the rest.

## How a prompt flows through the workflow

```
  idea               ── you write it in ideas.md
    │
    ▼
  draft prompt       ── you write a markdown file under
    │                   draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md
    ▼
  /start_dev         ── reads the prompt, audits the code, drafts an issue,
    │                   creates the GitHub issue, registers the task in
    │                   active.md, moves the prompt draft/ → active/
    ▼
  active.md entry    ── the task is now tracked across machines and sessions
    │
    ▼
  /start_library     ── creates a worktree, branch, opens dev environment
    or                  (or workspace variant — chosen automatically)
  /start_workspace
    │
    ▼
  development        ── code, tests, run smoke tests, commit

  /ship_library      ── runs tests, opens PR, waits for merge
    or
  /ship_workspace
    │
    ▼
  PR merged          ── post-merge cleanup deletes the worktree, drops the
    │                   active.md entry, and writes the dated completion record
    │                   complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md (lifecycle.py record)
    ▼
  done
```

The slash commands above are skills hosted across the organism (Brain, Heart) but
all read/write Mind's registry via workspace-root-anchored paths. One operates
over the registry without starting work:

- `/health status` — dashboard of `active.md`, `planned.md`, `complete/`
  (a PyAutoHeart status view, reached through the single `/health` door).
  Continuity across execution environments needs no special step — any
  environment reads `active.md` and resumes an in-flight task.

`PyAutoMind/skills/` now holds **only** the Mind-owned `create_issue` skill (plus
`OWNERSHIP.md`). The development-workflow skills were re-homed to the organs that
own them — **PyAutoBrain** (`start_dev`, `start_dev_for_user`, `plan_branches`,
`start_library`, `start_workspace`, `ship_library`, `ship_workspace`,
`health` [the single health door, with `check` sweep,
`status` dashboard, and `full` release-run legs]), **PyAutoHeart**
(`worktree_status`, and the health-leg procedures `health_sweep/`,
`pyauto-status/`, and `pyauto-status-full/` that `/health` drives), and
**autolens_profiling** (`profile_likelihood`). The
`handoff` skill was retired (PyAutoBrain runs uniformly across execution
environments — see `OWNERSHIP.md`). General PyAuto tooling (release prep,
dependency audits, smoke tests, lint sweeps) lives in the organ that owns it —
`PyAutoBrain/skills/`, `PyAutoHeart/skills/`, `PyAutoHands/`.

`scripts/prompt_sync.sh` is sourced by skills that mutate registry files
(`active.md`, `planned.md`, etc.) to commit and push back to origin. It
replaces a now-removed `admin_sync.sh` helper that formerly operated on
`admin_jammy/prompt/`.

---

## Prompt taxonomy

PyAutoMind organises **intent by the kind of thinking required; PyAutoBrain uses
that structure to choose the right reasoning agent.**

Prompts start at `draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md` (and advance
`draft/ → active/ → complete/YYYY/MM/`; issue #71):

- The **first folder** answers *what kind of thinking or agent is needed?* — the
  work type.
- The **second folder** answers *what domain or repository is affected?* — the
  target repo (`autoarray`, `autofit`, `autogalaxy`, `autolens`,
  `autolens_assistant`, `pyautobrain`, …), a workspace bucket (`workspaces`), or
  a topic series (`jax_substructure`, `weak`, `cluster`, `priors`).

### Work types → PyAutoBrain agents

| Folder | Holds | Future PyAutoBrain agent |
|--------|-------|--------------------------|
| `feature/` | new user-facing or scientific capabilities | feature planner |
| `bug/` | incorrect behaviour, crashes, regressions | debugger |
| `refactor/` | internal restructuring, no intended behaviour change | refactor architect |
| `docs/` | documentation, tutorials, notebooks, examples | documentation agent |
| `test/` | test coverage, smoke tests, validation scripts | test engineer |
| `release/` | packaging, versions, deployment, release readiness | release engineer |
| `maintenance/` | dependency updates, hygiene, cleanup, small tech debt | hygiene agent |
| `research/` | exploratory scientific / algorithmic investigation | research analyst |
| `human_review/` | work that already shipped and a human wants to sign off | (none — a person reviews) |

`human_review/` is the one work-type nothing infers. Every other folder answers
*what is this prompt about?*; this one records a human's judgement that a
**completed** task needs their eyes before it counts as done. File one by
declaring `Type: human review` (`human-review`/`human_review` read the same) —
`/intake` will never choose it for you, and no task acquires it by default.
Review is opt-in, not a lifecycle stage, so an empty section means nothing was
flagged, not that nothing shipped. It renders as its own **Human review** section
on `dashboard.md`, directly under *In flight*, and is not counted as backlog: a
review is not work to pick up, it is work waiting on you. Its 📋 hands out a
read-and-report prompt rather than a `/start_dev`. Sign one off by retiring the
prompt the usual way (`lifecycle.py record …`); don't sign it off and the
follow-up is an ordinary `/intake`.

`triage/` holds prompts whose classification is still unclear — file there with a
short note and re-home once the work type is obvious. The full mapping (and the
note that the agents themselves live in PyAutoBrain, not here) is in
[`ROUTING.md`](ROUTING.md).

### Good prompt paths

```
feature/autolens/potential_corrections.md
bug/autoarray/mask_edge_case.md
refactor/autofit/result_object_cleanup.md
docs/workspaces/pixelization_tutorial.md
research/autofit/sbi_design.md
human_review/autolens/scaling_relation_fit_quality.md
```

### Not work-types

`active/` and `complete/` are **workflow lifecycle** folders, not routed by work
type. `complete/archive/` holds retired non-record material — `epics/` (former
`z_features/` trackers) and `shelved/` (former `z_vault/` deferred prompts + dev
notes) — and is skipped by `lifecycle.py check`/`index`.

### Migration note

The repository previously used the target repo as the first folder
(`autoarray/foo.md`). Those prompts have moved to `<work-type>/autoarray/foo.md`.
Routing always keyed off the `@RepoName` references in a prompt's body, not its
folder, so the skills accept both old and new paths during the transition — but
new prompts should use the work-type layout.

---

## Conventions

### Naming

- Prompt filenames are lowercase `kebab_or_snake_case.md`.
- Numbered series use a leading number: `0_docs.md`, `1_simulator.md`. Skipping a
  number (e.g. `feature/weak/2_*.md` not present) is fine — it usually means a
  step was consolidated or deferred.
- **First folder = work type** (`feature/`, `bug/`, …); **second folder = target**
  repo or domain (lowercased, no `Py` prefix): `feature/autoarray/`,
  `bug/autofit/`, `refactor/autogalaxy/`. Workspace prompts go under
  `<work-type>/workspaces/` regardless of which workspace. See "Prompt taxonomy".

### Prompt file format

Free-form markdown. Strong conventions:

- Reference repos and files with `@RepoName/path/to/file.py` (e.g.
  `@PyAutoFit/autofit/non_linear/search.py`). `/start_dev` parses these to
  identify the primary target repo.
- One prompt = one task = one PR (ideally). If a prompt outlines several
  loosely-related changes, split before issuing.
- No frontmatter required. Title in the first line is helpful but optional.
- **Optional metadata header.** A prompt may carry a light, human-writable header
  near the top so both people and PyAutoBrain can see its type/target at a glance.
  This is a convention, not a schema — never required, no YAML frontmatter:

  ```markdown
  # Short task title

  Type: feature
  Target: PyAutoLens
  Repos:
  - PyAutoLens
  - autolens_workspace
  Themes:                   # optional; vocabulary in themes.md, primary first
  - mge
  - jax-gradient
  Difficulty: medium        # small | medium | large | too-large
  Autonomy: supervised      # safe | supervised | human-required
  Priority: normal          # low | normal | high
  Status: draft
  Consequence: glance       # notify | glance | judge — how much review it needs
  Witness: ids bit-identical, 62 -> 9.7 ms   # what makes it checkable in minutes
  Review-minutes: 3         # a seed, not a measurement
  Unattended: ready         # ready | needs-slicing | never
  Filed: 2026-07-09         # optional; the day the prompt was written
  Issued: 2026-08-19        # optional; set when the prompt advances to active/
  Blocked-by: PyAutoFit#1436          # optional; see "Declaring a gate" below
  Epic: cluster-strong-lensing        # optional; an entry in epics.md
  Bundle: euclid-pipeline-tidy        # optional; an entry in bundles.md
  ```

  When present, `Type:` should match the work-type folder. The goal is light
  structure, not bureaucracy — prompts stay free-form prose.

  **Declaring a gate — `Closes-when:` / `Blocked-by:`.** Both optional. A prompt
  that waits on something external can say so in a form `lifecycle.py issues
  --drafts` can grade:

  ```markdown
  Closes-when: autolens_profiling#70    # this prompt is DONE when that closes
  Blocked-by: PyAutoArray#431, PyAutoGalaxy#486   # READY TO START when all close
  ```

  The two readings are **opposite**, which is the whole point. Prose cannot be
  graded, so a cited issue could mean either and `--drafts` had to report every
  one as the same ambiguous question. With a declared key the tool reports the
  action instead: a closed `Closes-when:` says *likely shipped, verify and
  retire*; a closed `Blocked-by:` says *ready to start*. Prompts declaring a gate
  drop out of the ambiguous advisory list.

  Notes:
  - Accepts `Repo#123` shorthand (assumed `PyAutoLabs/`) or a full URL, and PRs
    as well as issues. Several refs may be comma-separated.
  - `Blocked-by:` clears only when **every** ref closes; a partly-satisfied gate
    is reported in its own weaker band rather than as ready.
  - Keys inside fenced code blocks are documentation and are ignored, so a prompt
    may show the syntax without declaring a gate.
  - Advisory, never a gate on the exit code: retiring a prompt writes to
    `complete/` and stays a human act.

  Motivated by the 2026-08-09 `draft/` sweep, where five prompts' stated gates
  had closed without anyone noticing — including one whose exit condition was met
  the same day it was written.

  **A Cortex-spawned dev follow-up gets its issue at filing — `Issue:`.** Normally a
  prompt has no GitHub issue until `/start_dev` opens one and moves it `draft/ →
  active/`. There is one exception, adopted 2026-09-01 (Cortex schema decision 55).
  A **PyAutoCortex** phase declares what it waits on in a `Gates:` line that may
  hold **GitHub refs only** — it cannot cite a Mind prompt path. So when a Cortex
  science phase is gated on Mind dev work that has not started, that dev prompt is
  filed as a draft **with its issue opened at the same moment**, so the Cortex phase
  has a ref to name. The prompt stays in `draft/` — an open issue here means
  "there is a ref", not "the work is in flight" — and carries the URL in its body:

  ```markdown
  Issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/<repo>/issues/<n> (opened <YYYY-MM-DD> as a Cortex gate ref; reuse in start_dev — never open a second)
  ```

  `create_issue` and `/start_dev` **reuse that issue** when the prompt is finally
  picked up — they must never open a second one. Two issues for one prompt is the
  failure this rule exists to prevent: the Cortex phase's gate would then be watching
  the wrong one, and would never clear.

  This applies *only* to Cortex-spawned gate refs. An ordinary draft still gets its
  issue at `/start_dev` time and nowhere earlier — filing issues ahead of the work in
  general is the bulk-issue-queue anti-pattern, which stays forbidden.

  **Declaring group membership — `Epic:` / `Bundle:`.** Both optional, both
  naming a slug in the matching registry file, and the two mean opposite things
  about ORDER. `Epic: <slug>` (`epics.md`, plus an optional `Phase: <n>`) says
  this prompt is one phase of an ordered programme: the dashboard pulls it out
  of every pick list and shows it only under its epic, worked in phase order.
  `Bundle: <slug>` (`bundles.md`) says the opposite — this prompt is
  INDEPENDENT, and a human has pinned it to a set worth running in one
  orchestrated session. A bundle member keeps its normal place on the
  dashboard and gains a Bundles card; it leaves only the *auto*-bundle pool,
  since it is already spoken for. A slug naming no registry entry still
  groups, loudly (⚠️ on the page), so a typo is visible rather than silent.

  **Declaring what the work is ABOUT — `Themes:`.** Optional, and the same
  list shape as `Repos:` — a bare `Themes:` line, then one `- keyword` bullet
  each. `Target:` says where the code lives; `Themes:` says what the work is
  about, which is usually the more useful grouping and is routinely cross-repo:

  ```markdown
  Themes:
  - mge
  - jax-gradient
  ```

  The **first** keyword is the primary theme and is what the dashboard's
  auto-bundler groups on, so a card reads "three things about MGE" rather than
  "three things that live in autoarray"; the remaining keywords are affinity,
  deciding which prompts pack together inside that group. One to three keywords
  is the intended shape, primary first. A prompt with no `Themes:` still
  bundles — the bundler falls back to `Target:` — so nothing waits on a theme.

  The vocabulary is [`themes.md`](themes.md), a plain markdown list a human
  edits directly (PyAutoBrain reads that file rather than holding its own
  copy). A keyword that is not in it still groups, loudly: ⚠️ on the bundle
  card and a count in the dashboard's Hygiene section, so the list never rots
  into free-text tags. The **Intake (Conception) Agent** assigns `Themes:` when
  it formalises a prompt.

  The optional `Difficulty:` / `Autonomy:` / `Priority:` keys let both people and
  PyAutoBrain see, at a glance, how hard a task is, whether an agent can safely
  take it on, and how urgent it is. What each `Autonomy:` level *does* at every
  workflow checkpoint is defined once in `PyAutoBrain/AUTONOMY.md` (the autonomy
  contract); levels bind only under an explicit `--auto` launch, and `--auto`
  runs append their outcome to `autonomy_log.md` (the calibration log). The **Intake (Conception) Agent** writes these
  automatically when it formalises a raw idea (`/intake`), sourcing `Difficulty:`
  from the shared sizing faculty the Feature Agent also uses — so the value shown
  up front is the one the Feature Agent later acts on. Still a convention, not a
  schema: all keys remain optional and there is **no YAML frontmatter**.

### The queue and the batch records

Two ledger surfaces the batch workflow adds. Both auto-merge
(`scripts/ledger_merge.py`): an unattended system that cannot record its own
history unattended will not record it.

- **[`queue.md`](queue.md)** — the human's ordered wishlist, and the only file
  they maintain by hand between slots. **Order is priority**; there is no
  `priority:` field, because moving an entry up *is* the act of prioritising it.
  An entry is a `prompt` (one named file) or `retired` (kept for the history of
  what was wanted and why it left). A batch is never composed here —
  `pyauto-brain batch plan` proposes one against a review-minute budget, and the
  human approves or edits it in the slot.
- **`batches/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<am|pm>.md`** — one record per dispatched batch,
  written at dispatch and appended at collection. Schema and the three fields
  that are easy to get wrong are in [`batches/AGENTS.md`](batches/AGENTS.md).

### The review-cost model

`Difficulty:` measures blast radius — how far a change reaches. It cannot answer
the question a batch has to be planned against, which is what the task will cost
**the human** once it lands. Four keys answer that, all derived by the sizing
faculty at conception and all overridable by declaring them:

- **`Consequence:`** `notify` | `glance` | `judge` — how much review the work
  needs. `notify` is work nobody outside this workshop consumes (docs,
  notebooks, profiling scripts, organ-repo tooling, test-only, a refactor with a
  byte-equality witness). `glance` is a witnessed change to a consumed repo: you
  read the witness, not the diff. `judge` is a PI's call — a public API, a
  default, an error contract, a science-policy question, an external reporter's
  request.

  **The declared tier also decides who merges** (2026-10-02,
  `PyAutoBrain/AUTONOMY.md` "Merge authority follows Consequence"). `notify`:
  the shipping session waits for CI inside its turn, merges on green and runs
  the `/prm` close-out itself. `glance`: the same, only when the `Witness:`
  check passed; the human reads a post-merge summary, and each auto-merge
  appends a row to the Shadow window in `autonomy_log.md` (confirmed at 20
  clean rows; any revert demotes `glance` back to a human `/prm`). `judge`, or
  no declared header: the human runs `/prm`, as before. Only a tier **written
  in the prompt** carries merge authority — a tier the sizing faculty would
  infer for a header-less prompt never does. Never auto-merged at any tier: a
  `decision-taken` PR, a Heart RED-override or corrective-PR-exception ship,
  red/pending/conflicting CI, or a SKIPPED test leg.
- **`Witness:`** free text: the machine-checkable claim that will make this
  reviewable in minutes rather than by reading the diff. Look at what the fast
  completion records carry — "ids bit-identical, 62 → 9.7 ms", "31-rule
  byte-equality", "0.068″ parity vs the published model". The slow ones carry
  prose.

  **No `Witness:` means `Consequence: judge`,** however small the task looks.
  That default is the point: choosing a cheap tier means committing, at
  conception, to producing evidence — which is what actually makes work
  reviewable quickly. It is also the one key nothing derives or backfills. An
  invented witness is plausible prose with nothing behind it, which is worse
  than none, because the value of the field is that its absence is informative.
  So `intake formalise` will never write one, and neither should you unless you
  mean it.
- **`Review-minutes:`** an integer **seed**, not a measurement — tier-driven,
  with one nudge for size. The honest numbers come from what the human actually
  spent, recorded per batch. Never cite a value here as evidence about how long
  something took.
- **`Unattended:`** `ready` | `needs-slicing` | `never` — can it finish without
  a human. Deliberately not `Difficulty:` renamed: `needs-slicing` keys off the
  **compaction rule** — a task that would need context compaction to finish is
  too big to run unattended — so a single-repo `large` task is still `ready`
  while a `large` one across four repos is not.

Measured over the 153 backlog prompts the day this shipped: **151 grade `judge`,
because three carry a witness.** Given one, the same backlog grades 33 `notify` /
104 `glance` / 16 `judge`. The whole distance between "everything costs a PI's
hour" and "a fifth of it costs nothing" is whether prompts say what will make
them checkable.

limits.

### `active.md` schema

Each task is an H2 section:

```markdown
## <task-name-kebab-case>
- issue: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>
- issued: YYYY-MM-DD                              # the day the task was issued

- status: <library-dev | workspace-dev | ready-to-ship | awaiting-input | …>
- library-pr: <url>               # optional until the PR exists; repeatable —

- worktree: ~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/<task-name>
- repos:
  - <RepoName>: feature/<branch-name>
- summary: |
    Free-form summary of progress and next steps.
```

The optional `session:` value is free text describing the actual harness and
session. Include a real resume command only when the harness and session ID are
known, for example `codex resume <id>` or `claude --resume <id>`. Otherwise record
the known harness and mark the session ID unavailable; omit the field when even
the harness is unknown. Never infer a provider or invent an ID. Existing values
and historical session records remain valid and are preserved verbatim.


#### The PR keys (`library-pr:` / `workspace-pr:`)

`ship_library` and `ship_workspace` write them; `/prm` reads them to find the
PRs it must merge; the dashboard links them. They were doing all three before
they were written down here, which is why nothing validated them and the
dashboard could only render the free-text `status:`.

- **Repeatable.** A task may ship several PRs of one kind (phase 2 of the
  `mind-post-cortex` epic opened three library PRs). Repeat the key on its own
  line, one URL each. The older single-line form — `- library-pr: <url>, <url>`
  — stays valid and is read the same way; nothing needs rewriting.
- **`library-pr:` means "a PR against a library or organ repo"** and
  `workspace-pr:` "a PR against a workspace, HowTo or assistant repo". The
  distinction is the merge order `/prm` enforces (library first), not the
  diff's contents.
- **The rule `lifecycle.py check` enforces:** a row whose `status:` says
  `awaiting-merge`, `PR open` or `shipped` must carry at least one `*-pr:`.
  A row that declares its PRs are open, and then does not say where they are,
  is a task `/prm` cannot close and a human cannot find.

**This one is drift, not a warning** — `check` exits 1 on it. A row that says
its PRs are open and then does not say where they are contradicts itself, which
is the class of thing this check exists to catch; there is nothing for a human
to weigh. The live ledger passed the day it shipped, so the first failure can
only be a new row.

The escalation ladder for the *other* new check is the opposite way round: an
uncleared `pending-release:` is reported and `check` still exits 0 (below), and
it stays that way. It is not a contradiction — the key's whole meaning is "not
released yet" — so it must never become a gate on the Mind's CI. If it ever
looks like it should escalate, the thing to fix is the release, not the check.

#### The pending-release chain (`pending-release:` / `release-gate:`)

A merged library PR is not a released library. Between the merge and the PyPI
publish, workspace work that depends on the new API is blocked, and until this
shipped the only machine view of that state was the Brain board's live `gh`
search over the `pending-release` label.

The division of labour is deliberate and this is the whole of it:

| Who | Holds |
|-----|-------|
| **GitHub** | the `pending-release` label on the merged library PR — the source of truth for "merged, not yet published" |
| **PyAutoHands** | the release that publishes it |
| **Mind** | the *link* (`pending-release: <lib>@<pr-url>`) and the *gate* (`release-gate: <lib>`) — nothing else |

- **Only the published set carries the chain.** `PUBLISHED_REPOS` in
  `scripts/lifecycle.py` (defined once; it mirrors the `release` job matrix
  of `PyAutoHands/.github/workflows/release.yml`, the job that uploads to PyPI
  and pushes the bare `<version>` tag) is PyAutoNerves, PyAutoFit,
  PyAutoArray, PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens. An organ, a workspace, a
  `_test`/`_developer`/HowTo/assistant/visualization/profiling repo is never
  published, so no release could clear a link to it — such a PR gets neither
  the label nor the line.
- `ship_library` writes `pending-release: <lib>@<pr-url>` on the task's
  `active.md` row when it opens a PR carrying the `pending-release` label —
  i.e. only for a published-set repo. `<lib>` is the library repo's name
  (`PyAutoArray`), the URL its PR; one link per line, nothing else on it.
  There is no placeholder: a task with no published-library PR simply has no
  `pending-release:` line (never `pending-release: none ...`).
- `ship_workspace` writes `release-gate: <lib>` on a workspace task that is
  blocked behind that library's release. One line per library.
- `/prm` close-out carries any uncleared, well-formed `pending-release:` from
  the `active.md` row into the completion record, so the obligation outlives
  the row.
- **`/review_release` step 6, the "Live run" branch, clears it** — that is the
  one step in the organism that establishes a release actually published. It
  runs one verb:

  ```bash
  python3 scripts/lifecycle.py clear-released --version <v>            # dry run
  python3 scripts/lifecycle.py clear-released --version <v> --apply --remove-labels
  ```

  which asks GitHub which links the release tag *contains* (the PR's merge
  commit is an ancestor of tag `<v>` — containment, never merge dates),
  deletes those `pending-release:` lines from `active.md` and `complete/`,
  drops a record's `release-gate: <lib>` once none of that library's links
  remain, regenerates the dashboard, and — with `--remove-labels` — drops the
  `pending-release` label from every released published-set PR, including
  labelled PRs the ledger never linked. `--apply` and `--remove-labels` are
  separate opt-ins; the default prints the plan and the `gh` commands. Nothing
  else may clear the key: a release that was dispatched is not a release that
  published. (PyAutoHands' release workflow also runs the label half after a
  successful publish; the Mind half stays with this step.)
- `lifecycle.py check` **errors** on a `pending-release:` value that is not
  `<published-repo>@https://github.com/<owner>/<same-repo>/pull/<n>` — a
  malformed line, a placeholder, or a non-published repo can never be
  cleared, so it is drift.
- `lifecycle.py check` **warns** (never errors) on a `complete/` record whose
  well-formed `pending-release:` is still uncleared after
  `PENDING_RELEASE_STALE_DAYS` (14) days. A stale link is a bookkeeping miss,
  not drift — the library may legitimately not have been released yet.
  `lifecycle.py check --network [<v>]` (opt-in; needs `gh`) adds a warning
  for every link the latest (or named) release already contains, so a missed
  sweep surfaces the same day instead of a fortnight later.

The dashboard's **Pending release** section renders this **from the ledger
only** — it never calls `gh` at render time, and it says so in its own blurb.
The Brain board's live query stays the fresh view; the dashboard section is the
view that works offline, in CI, and on a phone, and that says what the Mind
*believes* rather than what GitHub *currently reports*. When the two disagree,
GitHub is right and the ledger needs a `/review_release` pass.

### Task dates

The Mind used to date only what it **finished** — every completion record
carries `completed:` — so it could answer "what shipped in July?" but not "what
did we start?". Every task now carries a machine-readable date from the moment
it leaves the backlog:

| Where | Field | The event it dates |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| `active.md` | `- issued: YYYY-MM-DD` | the day the task got its GitHub issue |
| `planned.md` | `- filed: YYYY-MM-DD` | the day it was scoped |
| `parked.md` | `- parked: YYYY-MM-DD` | the day it stopped |
| `draft/**/<name>.md` | `Filed: YYYY-MM-DD` | the day the prompt was written |
| `active/<name>.md` | `Issued: YYYY-MM-DD` | the day it got its issue, in its light header |
| `complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md` | `- completed: YYYY-MM-DD` | unchanged — the ledger already did this |

The backlog is the **largest** pool of tasks the Mind holds — 150 prompts
against a handful of live rows — so `draft/` carrying a date is what lets the
dashboard's Recent feed see most of the work at all. A prompt keeps its
`Filed:` when it advances to `active/` and gains an `Issued:`; the later, more
specific event is the one that dates the task.

The **key names the event**, so a merged feed can say what each date means
rather than showing a bare timestamp. Reading is tolerant: `registered:`,
`started:`, `planned:`, `found:` and `shipped:` are all read as dates too (the
registries are hand-edited by many sessions, and an entry that says when it
happened should count however it said it) — the table is what a *writer*
should use. The most specific event wins when an entry carries several, so a
task that was filed and later issued dates from its issue.

A date inside another field's prose (`- issue: …/1501 (issued 2026-08-19)`) is
deliberately **not** read — that is the un-parseable habit this convention
replaces. The prompt's `Issued:` header is its own copy of the registry date,
so an issued prompt stays dated even if its registry row goes missing.

`scripts/lifecycle.py dates` reports every entry and issued prompt carrying no
date; `dates --write` backfills them retroactively from the evidence the repo
already holds, annotating each inferred date with where it came from:

```
Issued: 2026-08-18 (backfilled from parked.md `parked:`)
```

The sources, in order: git — the commit that introduced the entry, wrote the
draft, or moved the prompt into `active/`; the prompt's own Intake trailer
(`<!-- formalised by the Intake (Conception) Agent on … -->`); the dated
registry entry that claims the prompt; a date the entry already stated in its
own prose.

The two states want **opposite** readings of the same history, and the switch is
`--follow`. An `active/` prompt dates from the day it *arrived* there (being
issued is a `git mv`, so following the rename back would report the wrong day);
a `draft/` prompt dates from the day it was *written*, wherever it lived then —
the 2026-07-13 lifecycle migration `git mv`-ed 42 prompts in one commit, and
without `--follow` all 42 would date from the migration rather than from
themselves. Nothing is guessed — an entry with no
evidence is reported for a human to date by hand. A **shallow** clone (CI, a
cloud session) cannot see past its boundary commit, so git dates at or before
it are discarded rather than stamping every task with the day the clone was
made.

The dashboard's [Recent](dashboard.md#recent) table is the payoff: it holds the
50 newest events on the work in hand — issued, parked, filed — and shows 10,
opening the next 10 on each tap of `…`. Shipped work stays out of it;
`complete/index.md` is where the ledger is read.

### Completion record (`complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md`) schema

The dated records are the completion ledger (`complete/AGENTS.md`; the
monolithic `complete.md` was retired 2026-07-16, issue #81). Each record opens
with the same fields the old ledger entries carried, then the rich narrative
and, appended by `lifecycle.py record`, the original prompt:

```markdown
## <task-name>
- issue: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>
- completed: YYYY-MM-DD
- library-pr: <url> [, <url>]
- workspace-pr: <url> [, <url>]
- pending-release: <lib>@<pr-url>   # optional; carried from the active.md row by
                                    # /prm, cleared by /review_release on a live
                                    # run (see "The pending-release chain")
- summary: <what landed, gotchas, follow-ups — free-form bullets>

## Original prompt

<the active/ prompt the task started from>
```

### Epic trackers (retired 2026-07-13)

Multi-task **epic trackers** (umbrella markdown files listing a sequence of
sub-prompts) formerly lived in `z_features/`. That folder was retired into
`complete/archive/epics/` once the `draft/ → active/ → complete/` lifecycle made
its `z_`-prefixed home redundant. The per-task completion records live in
`complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/`; the archived trackers keep the epic-level narrative.

## How the ledger lands (`mind_ledger_merge.yml`)

A branch-scoped session — a phone, web, or CLI run on `claude/**` or `codex/**` —
pushes its Mind changes to a feature branch, never to `main`
(`prompt_sync.sh` pushes HEAD deliberately, so a cloud session cannot bypass
review). Nothing downstream used to move that branch on: no workflow so much as
*looks* at those branch pushes, because `lifecycle_drift`, `dashboard_refresh`,
`firewall_gate` and `spawn_drift` all trigger on `push: main` or
`pull_request` only. A filed prompt, a task moved to `complete/`, a regenerated
dashboard — all of it waited for a human to write an explicit "merge that
branch" prompt, and the dashboard rendered a stale backlog until they did.

`.github/workflows/mind_ledger_merge.yml` closes that seam. On every push to
`claude/**`, `codex/**` or `chatgpt/**` it classifies the branch's diff against `main` and, when the whole
diff is **ledger**, merges it and deletes the branch. No session step, no PR,
no prompt.

**Ledger** is drawn by `scripts/ledger_merge.py`, and it is **default deny**:

| Ledger — merged automatically | Code — always a human |
|---|---|
| `draft/**`, `active/**`, `complete/**` | `scripts/`, `tests/`, `.github/`, `skills/`, `policy/`, `docs/` |
| `active.md`, `planned.md`, `parked.md`, `condemned.md`, `epics.md`, `bundles.md`, `ideas.md`, `autonomy_log.md` | `repos.yaml`, `themes.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `REFERENCE.md`, `ROUTING.md`, … |
| `dashboard.md`, `dashboard.html` | anything unclassified — a new root file, a new top-level folder |

Two exceptions inside the ledger dirs: a **dot-path** anywhere, and a file
pytest would **collect** (`conftest.py`, `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`) — inert
prompt assets like `draft/bug/autofit/*_assets/run_once.py` ride along, a file
CI would execute does not. The workflow's own file and the gate script are on
the code side of the line, so neither can auto-merge a change to itself.

Predict the verdict before you push:

```bash
python3 scripts/ledger_merge.py classify --base origin/main   # exit 0 = will auto-merge
```

`--base` reads the diff from git and nothing else — never stdin — so it is safe
to run from a web/mobile session, whose stdin is a harness socket that never
closes. Piped paths (`classify < paths`) are read only when neither explicit
paths nor `--base` is given.

What blocks, and what does not:

- **`lifecycle.py check` blocks — for the branch's own paths.** Structural
  drift — a prompt in `active/` with no `active.md` entry — is a real
  contradiction and nothing heals it. The check runs `--paths <the branch's
  diff> --base origin/main`, on the branch and again on the trial merge, so a
  finding about a row the branch never touched is reported as out of scope
  rather than stranding three records for it (run 34677840370, 2026-09-12).
- **Renders are regenerated on the merged tree.** `complete/index.md`, the
  registry contents blocks and the dashboard pages are rebuilt inside the
  merge commit (and still self-heal on `main`, which the workflow dispatches
  after the push because a `GITHUB_TOKEN` push triggers no workflows).
- **A conflict is settled by the ledger's grammar first.** The merge is built
  with `--no-commit`; `scripts/ledger_merge.py resolve` merges the `## slug`
  registries (`active.md`, `planned.md`, `parked.md`, `condemned.md`,
  `epics.md`) **by entry** — an entry changed on one side wins, an entry both
  sides changed differently is the only conflict — takes `main`'s copy of the
  renders, and leaves `autonomy_log.md` to git's `merge=union` driver
  (`.gitattributes`; it is append-only). What that cannot settle blocks.
- **A blocked branch is written on an issue** titled ``ledger merge: `<branch>`
  needs a human`` (label `ledger-merge`), updated on every further attempt and
  closed by the run that finally lands it. A red run nobody is subscribed to
  is how six completion records went missing in August–September 2026.
- **A branch already in `main` is deleted** the same way a freshly merged one
  is, so a merge whose delete never fired does not stand forever (69 had by
  2026-09-17).

An open PR on the branch is merged **through** the PR, so it records as
`MERGED`; a branch with no PR gets a direct merge commit and is then deleted on
the same proof `branch_sweep.yml` uses — `main` must actually contain the head
sha. `workflow_dispatch` runs the same gate in `audit` mode by default, so a
manual look never merges by accident.

## Tracking and inspection

### Quick inventory

```bash
bash scripts/status.sh
```

Prints counts per category, lists the active and recently-completed tasks, and
and lists the recently-completed tasks.

### Scoping a drift check to one branch — `check --paths`

`lifecycle.py check` grades the whole repo, which is right on `main` and wrong
on a branch: `mind_ledger_merge.yml` runs it over the merged tree, so a ledger
branch that added three completion records was refused because an unrelated
`active.md` row carried no `library-pr:` (run 34677840370, 2026-09-12) — drift
the branch neither caused nor could fix. A branch can only be held to its own
diff:

```bash
python3 scripts/lifecycle.py check --paths $(git diff --name-only origin/main) \
                                   --base origin/main
```

- `--paths` is repeatable and takes a space-separated list; a directory covers
  everything under it. Findings about anything else are printed as
  `~ out of scope: …` — reported, so nothing is hidden, but they leave the exit
  code alone.
- A finding about a *prompt* or a *record* is in scope when that file is
  listed. A finding about a **registry entry** is in scope when the entry's
  `prompt:` path — or a file its slug names, in `active/` or in `complete/` —
  is listed. That last rule is what makes `--paths <the record you just wrote>`
  answer for the `active.md` row you forgot to drop with it: the row and the
  record are the same task under two names.
- Naming a registry file itself (`active.md`, `planned.md`, `parked.md`) puts
  **all** its entries in scope, because nothing in the file says which rows the
  diff touched. `--base <ref>` supplies that: it diffs the registry against the
  ref and counts only the entries the hunks land in. An unreadable ref (a typo,
  a shallow clone) reads as "all of them" — unknown never shrinks the scope.
- A finding about no path at all (the shallow-clone note) is a fact about the
  checkout and stays in scope wherever it runs.

Without `--paths`, behaviour is exactly what it was.

### Closing a task out — `close`

The Mind side of `/prm` as one verb. It **composes** the existing verbs rather
than reimplementing them (`record` still writes the record, folds the prompt,
refreshes `complete/index.md` and prunes `active.md`; `shadow-row` still
appends to the window):

```bash
python3 scripts/lifecycle.py close <slug> --date YYYY-MM-DD --from-file <body.md> \
    [--prompt <path|filename>] [--pr Repo#N …] \
    [--tier glance --gate "<cell>" --action <merged-unchanged|…> [--stage 1|2]] \
    [--no-shadow-row] [--apply]
```

Dry run by default: it prints the record path, the prompt it will remove, every
registry entry it will drop, the shadow row it would append, and the references
it found — and writes nothing. `--apply` does it.

- **The prompt resolves anywhere it can be.** `record --prompt` resolves under
  `active/` only and no-ops in silence when it misses; `close` looks in
  `active/`, in the registries' own `prompt:` paths and in `draft/` (a task may
  ship straight off a draft, which `record` cannot fold at all). `--prompt`
  takes a repo-relative path or a bare filename.
- **It drops the `parked.md` / `planned.md` pointer too**, which `record` does
  not — only `active.md` was ever pruned.
- **The shadow row is never inferred.** Only `--tier glance` feeds the window
  (re-scoped from `notify` on 2026-10-02, when `notify` auto-merge was granted),
  and only with `--gate` and `--action`: the row records the gate that *ran* and
  what *happened* to the PR — `merged-unchanged` at an auto-merge, amended by
  the human if they later find something substantive, `reverted` if it was
  backed out — so a missing cell yields no row and a line saying so.
  `--no-shadow-row` suppresses the leg outright.
- **Two refusals**, both exit 1: a record for the slug already exists anywhere
  under `complete/` (a completion record is the one file here that is not
  regenerable), or the slug resolves to no prompt in `active/`, `draft/` or a
  registry.
- **It reports, it does not repoint.** Remaining mentions of the closed task in
  `draft/`, `active/`, `epics.md`, `planned.md` and `parked.md` print under
  "repoint these" — which ones the merge falsified is a judgement.
- **It does not render the dashboard.** The state is the Mind's and the renderer
  is the Brain's, and `main` heals the render (`dashboard_refresh.yml`); the
  `pyauto-brain intake --apply dashboard` line is printed as the optional next
  step.
- **It stages nothing.** The record is written and the prompt removed with plain
  filesystem ops; `git add -A` what it changed, then
  `check --paths` before you push.

### From inside Claude Code

- `/health status` — dashboard of registry state (active, planned, recent complete; PyAutoHeart, via the `/health` door)
- `/start_dev draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md` — read a prompt and route it (PyAutoBrain)
- `/worktree_status` — cross-references registry with task worktrees (PyAutoHeart)

## How this repo integrates with the rest

The PyAuto workflow has these repos with distinct roles:

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **PyAutoMind** (this repo) | The Mind: ideas, intent, goals, priorities, the prompt registry and prompt-coupled skills. The starting point. |
| **PyAutoMemory** | The Memory organ: topical LLM wikis (`wiki/lensing/`, `wiki/smbh/`, `wiki/cti/`, `wiki/methods/`, `wiki/galaxies/`) and a reading queue (`reading-queue.md`, moved from `admin_jammy/papers.md`). |
| **`PyAuto*` libraries and `*_workspace*` repos** | Where the actual code work happens. Each task gets a feature branch + worktree under `~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/<task-name>/`. |

Helper scripts that this repo's skills source:

- `PyAutoBrain/bin/worktree.sh` — task worktree management (create, remove, conflict check).

These live in `PyAutoBrain/bin/` because they're general organism-wide tooling,
not prompt-specific. The skills that need them source by absolute path.

---

## Bootstrap on a new machine

```bash
cd ~/Code/PyAutoLabs
git clone git@github.com:PyAutoLabs/PyAutoMind.git    # the Mind (this repo)
git clone git@github.com:PyAutoLabs/PyAutoBrain.git   # dev-workflow skills
git clone git@github.com:PyAutoLabs/PyAutoHeart.git   # status / readiness skills
bash PyAutoBrain/bin/install.sh                        # symlinks skills + commands
```

> **The local checkout directory must be named `PyAutoMind`.** The skills and
> scripts reference `PyAutoMind/...` paths directly — e.g.
> `source PyAutoMind/scripts/prompt_sync.sh` and `git -C PyAutoMind …` — so a
> differently-named directory breaks those commands.

`install.sh` auto-discovers skills from every present discovery root
(`admin_jammy/skills/`, `PyAutoMind/skills/`, `PyAutoBrain/skills/`,
`PyAutoHeart/skills/`, `autolens_profiling/skills/`) and creates symlinks under
`~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/commands/`. Roots that aren't checked out are
skipped. Re-run any time after pulling new skills from any of those repos.

## Agent operational walkthrough

This longer walkthrough is loaded when a Mind operation needs its detail;
`AGENTS.md` holds the immediately applicable rules.

## Layout (operational)

- **Prompt lifecycle (issue #71)** — a prompt file advances through three
  top-level state folders, mirroring the task ledger:
  - `draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md` — intaken, **not started**. The
    first folder under `draft/` is the *kind of work*; the second is the
    *target repo or domain*. Work-types: `feature/`, `bug/`, `refactor/`,
    `docs/`, `test/`, `release/`, `maintenance/`, `research/`
    (plus `triage/` for prompts whose classification is still unclear, and
    `human_review/` for work that already shipped and a human wants to sign
    off — declaration-only, see below).
    PyAutoBrain routes by the work-type folder — see [Prompt taxonomy](#prompt-taxonomy) and `ROUTING.md`.
  - `active/<name>.md` — **issued** (an open GitHub issue / in flight). The
    ship skills advance the file to `complete/` on merge.
  - `complete/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>.md` — **shipped**; the rich completion record
    (see `complete/AGENTS.md`). Months are zero-padded so lexical order is
    numerical order. `scripts/lifecycle.py` owns the moves and drift-checks
    them.

  Retired non-record material lives in **`complete/archive/`** (skipped by
  `lifecycle.py check`/`index`): `archive/epics/` (former `z_features/`
  multi-task trackers) and `archive/shelved/` (former `z_vault/` deferred
  prompts + dev notes). The old `z_features/`, `z_vault/` and `autoprompt/`
  top-level folders were retired here on 2026-07-13.
- **Registry** — root-level markdown files, each with one job: `active.md`
  (in-flight tasks), `planned.md` (scoped, not started), `parked.md` (started
  but not in flight), `condemned.md` (self-material staged for the Gut's
  transit-and-void lifecycle — see PyAutoGut), `epics.md` (long-running
  multi-phase programmes and the ledger file that holds each one's state),
  `ideas.md` (raw inbox swept by
  `$intake`, `/intake` in Claude). Mutate these only via the skills in `skills/` so commit
  messages stay consistent.
  `dashboard.md` is the **generated** read-only view over all of it (the page
  the README links): regenerate with `pyauto-brain intake --apply dashboard`
  after any registry or `draft/` change you want reflected immediately — never
  hand-edit it. `dashboard_refresh.yml` self-heals it on pushes to `main`, so a
  missed regeneration is drift that fixes itself, not a broken page — but it
  heals only the **render**. A prompt that shipped and was never retired to
  `complete/` renders faithfully, as pickable backlog, and no workflow can tell
  the difference; retiring it is a human/skill judgement. Per task that is
  `/prm`'s close-out (it sweeps the shipped prompt's folder and regenerates the
  page in the same commit); across the whole backlog it is
  `pyauto-brain intake reconcile` plus the refresh payload on the dashboard
  itself.
  `parked.md` holds tasks that were started or scoped but are not currently
  in flight (e.g. work parked in a stash, orphan worktrees); move back to
  `active.md` (or `planned.md` if re-scoping) when resuming.
- **Body map** — `repos.yaml` is the single source of repo *identity* (GitHub
  home, category, one-line role) and explicit generated-adapter rollout for
  every repo in the workspace. The routing
  table in the workspace-root `AGENTS.md` and the owner map in
  `PyAutoBrain/skills/WORKFLOW.md` are generated from it, and the repo lists in
  Heart/Build/admin scripts are drift-checked against it:
  `python3 scripts/repos_sync.py --write`.
- **Policy** — `policy/` holds the universal rules single-sourced here and
  generated verbatim into every repo's AGENTS.md by `repos_sync.py --write`:
  `never_rewrite_history.md`, `remote_sessions.md`, `end_at_deliverable.md`,
  `where_to_file.md`
  (plus the hooks that enforce them, `session_start_hook.sh` and
  `end_at_deliverable_hook.sh`). Edit the canonical file, never a generated copy.
  `repos_sync.py --write --only "generated Codex hooks"` renders opted-in
  `.codex/hooks.json` adapters without touching the broader generated surface.
  Codex users must review and trust the exact current hook hash with `/hooks`;
  changed or untrusted project hooks are skipped. These adapters register the
  reviewed PreToolUse safety guards only. The remote Python SessionStart
  bootstrap remains Claude-specific and is not silently copied into Codex.
  `community_surface.md` is the one policy page that is *not* generated
  anywhere: it decides where users go (one Discussions hub) and where the
  development flow stays (per-repo issues); the Ears and the README Support
  sections read it as doctrine.
- **Skills** — `skills/<name>/` are agent skills and command bodies tightly
  coupled to the registry. Claude and Codex discovery is installed by
  PyAutoBrain; they source `scripts/prompt_sync.sh` for commit/push.
- **Ledger auto-merge** — a push to `claude/**`, `codex/**` or `chatgpt/**` whose whole diff is *ledger*
  (`draft/`, `active/`, `complete/`, the root registry files, the dashboard
  pages) is merged into `main` by `.github/workflows/mind_ledger_merge.yml` and
  the branch deleted — no PR, no session step, no "please merge that" prompt.
  Anything touching `scripts/`, `tests/`, `.github/`, `skills/`, `policy/`,
  `docs/`, `repos.yaml` or the prose pages is left for a human, as is anything
  unclassified (the gate is default deny). So: **push your Mind work and move
  on** — do not leave a ledger branch hanging, and do not expect a code branch
  to land by itself. `python3 scripts/ledger_merge.py classify --base
  origin/main` tells you which side you are on before you push; the full
  contract is in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) "How the ledger lands". A
  conflict on the registries or the generated pages is settled by the
  ledger's own grammar (`ledger_merge.py resolve`: entries merge by slug,
  renders take main and are regenerated); a branch that still cannot land
  gets an issue labelled `ledger-merge`, never a silent red run.
  Optional `active.md` session metadata records the actual harness and a known
  resume command when available; existing `claude --resume` values remain valid.
  An ordinary ChatGPT conversation that needs to publish **Mind ledger-only**
  state uses a `chatgpt/**` Mind branch so the identical default-deny ledger
  gate can land it. This namespace is only a transport adapter: it grants no
  extra paths, autonomy or merge authority. Development/source branches keep
  their normal task branch names. No OpenAI API key or API Platform call is
  involved.
- **Scripts** — `scripts/status.sh` (inventory), `scripts/prompt_sync.sh`
  (commit/push helpers), `scripts/lifecycle.py` (state moves + drift checks;
  `lifecycle.py dates [--write]` reports/backfills the date every registry
  entry and issued prompt carries — see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) "Task
  dates").

## When you are asked to add a new prompt

Write the file under `draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md` — pick the work-type
from the list above (use `triage/` if genuinely unsure — never `human_review/`,
see below) and the target
repo/domain as the second folder, e.g. `draft/feature/autolens/potential_corrections.md`
or `draft/bug/autoarray/mask_edge_case.md`. Don't touch `active.md`, `active/`
or `complete/` directly — those are managed by `$start-dev`, `$create-issue`
and the ship skills (`/start_dev` and `/create_issue` in Claude).

To skip the manual filing, run **`$intake`** (`/intake` in Claude), the
PyAutoBrain Intake/Conception Agent. It classifies a raw idea into the right
`draft/<work-type>/<target>/` folder,
writes the light header (incl. the optional `Difficulty:/Autonomy:/Priority:`
keys — see [Prompt file format](#prompt-file-format)), and files the prompt for you. It files a
prompt only; `$start-dev` (`/start_dev` in Claude) remains the separate next step.

## When you are asked for a human review

`draft/human_review/<target>/<name>.md` holds work that has already **shipped**
and that a human wants to read and sign off before it counts as done. It is the
one work-type nothing may infer: file one only when a human asks for it, by
declaring `Type: human review` (`human-review`/`human_review` read the same) —
`/intake` will never choose it, and no completed task acquires it by default.
Review is opt-in, not a lifecycle stage: `/prm` and the ship skills close a task
out exactly as before and never file a review.

It renders as its own **Human review** section on `dashboard.md`, directly under
*In flight*, and is deliberately not counted as backlog — a review is not work to
pick up, it is work waiting on a person. Its 📋 hands out a read-and-report
prompt, not a `/start_dev`. Sign one off by retiring the prompt the usual way
(`scripts/lifecycle.py record …`, then regenerate the dashboard); if it does not
pass, the follow-up is an ordinary `$intake`.

## When you are asked to start work on an existing prompt

Use `$start-dev draft/<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md` (`/start_dev` in Claude).
Older `<work-type>/<target>/<name>.md` and bare `<target>/<name>.md` paths from
before the lifecycle migration still resolve. It
routes to `$start-library` or `$start-workspace` (`/start_library` or
`/start_workspace` in Claude) based on the repos referenced in the prompt body;
routing keys off `@RepoName` references in the content, not the folder.

## When in doubt

Read [README.md](README.md). It is current as of the last commit on this branch.
